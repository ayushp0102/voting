# voting
A voting machine that captures an image of identification card and performs image recognition on it using Tesseract to identify an individual. The individual's admission number is checked with the server to confirm voting for the first time. 

It also features IR sensors that allow an individual to hover his/her hand over the pushbuttons and access the details of the candidate in real time on the screen. Finally, upon presing the relevant pushbutton, the vote is uploaded to the server.
